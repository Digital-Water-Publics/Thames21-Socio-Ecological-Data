## Project Description
Aims and objectives: Working with the London rivers trust Thames21, this project will co-create an
online dashboard that advances public understanding of how river quality affects the way Londoners
feel about their local environment. The dashboard will map river-related social media sentiment onto
water quality data from Defra. Users are invited to explore a map-based visualisation of social and
environmental data linked to local rivers in Greater London, learn about how water quality affects
well-being, and interact with the dashboard by contributing their own sentiment to the map. Using
computational social science methods for emotion recognition in natural language, the project pilots
the integration of emotional AI with social media and open government data for a participatory
approach to environmental intelligence. The project addresses two principal societal needs as
defined by Thames21:
1) Increase public awareness of the link between environmental quality and social well-being,
particularly using innovative, digital means designed to engage and empower diverse London
communities that are hard to reach with traditional media.
2) Trial an agile, low-cost and open toolkit for demonstrating the impact of local river quality on
community well-being, for which there exists an evidence gap particularly at the local scale
due to the considerable time and resource requirements of established survey methods.
