White water is dangerous. It is such a thrill crashing through the waves! White water is dangerous. From the movie Top Gun: ‚ÄúTop Gun rules of engagement are written for your safety and for that of your team. They are not flexible, nor am I. Either obey them or you are history. Is that clear?‚Äù Instructors must be obeyed without question. Risks can be minimised, but that is dependant on instructions being followed to the letter. White water is wet. You will get wet. Plan on it. Dumping is part of the learning process. If you never dump, you aren‚Äôt trying hard enough. Canoeing versus Rafting. Your parents will think this is like white water rafting. It is not. In a raft, 99% of the time you will make it to the bottom of a rapid right side up, no matter what you do. In a canoe, if you do not paddle correctly, 99% of the time you will dump. This is the challenge that makes white water enjoyable. Rafting is boring in comparison.
